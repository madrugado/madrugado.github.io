title: Who am I
---


I am Senior Research Scientist at Huawei [Noah's Ark lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/) and also doing some research projects with [Kazan Federal University](https://kpfu.ru/eng), my field of study is Natural Language Understanding, since NLU seems to be not possible without Deep Learning, the DL is my secondary area of interest. 

<br />

I have graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology with Major in Computer Science in 2009. I wrote my PhD thesis also there and defended it at Institute for Systems Programming, Russian Academy of Sciences in 2019. My PhD thesis and synopsis are available [here](https://www.ispras.ru/dcouncil/docs/diss/2019/malyh/malyh.php) (in Russian). The brief English version of the sinopsis is [published at ACL](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-2002/) last year.
My publications could be found [here](./publications.md). If you want to read any publication, which is listed, but has no link, just write me an email.

<br />
I have worked at VK.com as Applied Research Scientist, and have a couple of papers published describing my work there.
Also I have worked as a Research Scientist at Neural Systems and Deep Learning lab of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where I participated in research and development of <a href="https://deeppavlov.ai">DeepPavlov library</a>.

I have wide experience in Information Retrieval:
- I've improved VK.com Support with FAQ recommedation.
- I've worked on Yandex.News quality (ranking and clusterization).
- I've launched (as part of a team) the Sputnik, Russian government-sponsored search engine.

I also have experience with Computer Vision & Robotics:
- I've developed CV for a robot (see below) & some aspects of Cognitive Technologies driver-assistant.
- For the testing purposes, we've created a wheeled robot, where I was resposible for driving control (including the CV part).

<br />

My short CV is available [here](resume/one-page-cv.pdf). The full CV is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ce0d73trfwtfc7h/academic_CV2.pdf?dl=1).
